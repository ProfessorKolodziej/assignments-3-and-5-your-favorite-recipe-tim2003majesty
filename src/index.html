                    <p>They taste like a gingerbread latte!
                        <br>Just like a gingerbread latte, these cookies are spiced
                        with classic gingerbread cookie spices and infused with espresso for a hint of caffeine.
                    </p>
                    <p>Soft and chewy! <br> These soft-baked cookies are as delightfully chewy as my Vegan Ginger
                        Cookies and Ginger Crinkle Cookies.</p>
                    <p>Simple espresso icing! <br> A drizzle of the easy, 4-ingredient espresso glaze is the
                        perfect
                        finishing touch on these latte-inspired cookies. For an easy alternative, melt some vegan
                        white chocolate and drizzle it over the cookies instead.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Use an electric mixer to beat the vegan butter, brown sugar, espresso powder, and vanilla
                        together in a large bowl until creamy. Next, beat in the molasses until smooth. Add the flour,
                        baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix until combined.
                        Add about 1 cup of granulated sugar to a small bowl for rolling.</p>
                    <p>Use your hands to roll pieces of the dough into balls, then roll each ball in the granulated
                        sugar to coat the outside. Place the sugar-coated cookie dough balls on prepared baking sheets
                        and bake until the cookies begin to crack on top.</p>
                    <p>The cookies will look very soft when they're done baking but they'll firm up a lot as they cool.
                        If you prefer crispy cookies, bake them for 2 to 3 minutes longer.</p>

                    <p>Is the icing too runny? Whisk in a little more powdered sugar to thicken the consistency. Is it
                        too thick? Stir in a splash of milk until it's thinned to your liking.</p>
                    <p>Drizzle the espresso glaze over the cooled cookies and let them aside until the icing hardens.

                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with
                        nonstick spray.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the softened vegan butter, brown sugar, espresso powder and
                        vanilla together until creamy. Now add the molasses and beat in until smooth. Scrape the sides as
                        needed with a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix until combined. Place about a
                        cup of granulated sugar in a bowl (this is optional, for rolling).</li>
                    <li>Scoop out about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough, roll into a ball, then roll each ball in the sugar until
                        completely coated (or not, rolling in sugar is optional).</li>
                    <li>Place on the prepared baking sheets, and bake for 11-12 minutes, until they begin to crack on top.
                        They will look very soft, but they firm up a lot as they cool. If you over bake, they will be
                        crispy.</li>
                    <li>Let cool on the pans for 5-10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.</li>
                    <li>Make the espresso glaze: Whisk the glaze ingredients together until smooth and creamy. If it's too
                        runny, add additional powdered sugar to thicken. If too thick, add a bit of milk.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle glaze onto the cookies and let set for 10-20 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
