	<p>A gingerbread latte is a seasonal drink and the inspiration for these vegan Gingerbread Latte Cookies! From the comforting gingerbread spices to the molasses flavors to the sweet glaze on top, these cookies have everything you love about the drink. Plus, they’re easy to make with simple plant-based baking staples and take 30 minutes to prep and bake.</p>
	<h2>Why you’ll love these vegan gingerbread latte cookies</h2>
	<p>They taste like a gingerbread latte! Just like a gingerbread latte, these cookies are spiced with classic gingerbread cookie spices and infused with espresso for a hint of caffeine.</p>
	<p>Soft and chewy – These soft-baked cookies are as delightfully chewy as my Vegan Ginger Cookies and Ginger Crinkle Cookies.</p>
	<p>Simple espresso icing – A drizzle of the easy, 4-ingredient espresso glaze is the perfect finishing touch on these latte-inspired cookies. For an easy alternative, melt some vegan white chocolate and drizzle it over the cookies instead.</p>

	<p>Use an electric mixer to beat the vegan butter, brown sugar, espresso powder, and vanilla together in a large bowl until creamy. Next, beat in the molasses until smooth. Add the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix until combined.</p>
	<p>Add about 1 cup of granulated sugar to a small bowl for rolling.</p>
	<p>Use your hands to roll pieces of the dough into balls, then roll each ball in the granulated sugar to coat the outside. Place the sugar-coated cookie dough balls on prepared baking sheets and bake until the cookies begin to crack on top.</p>
	<p>The cookies will look very soft when they’re done baking but they’ll firm up a lot as they cool. If you prefer crispy cookies, bake them for 2 to 3 minutes longer.</p>

	<p>Set the cookies aside to cool while you whisk the icing ingredients together in a small bowl.</p>
	<p>Is the icing too runny? Whisk in a little more powdered sugar to thicken the consistency. Is it too thick? Stir in a splash of milk until it’s thinned to your liking.</p>
	<p>Drizzle the espresso glaze over the cooled cookies and set them aside until the icing hardens. Enjoy!</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup vegan butter softened to room temperature</p>
			<li>1 cup packed brown sugar</p>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon espresso powder</p>
			<li>1 tablespoons pure vanilla extract</p>
			<li>1/2 cup molasses</p>
			<li>3 cups all purpose flour</p>
			<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
			<li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</p>
			<li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</p>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</p>
			<li>more sugar, optional for rolling cookies in</p>
		</ul>
	<h3>Espresso Glaze</h3>
		<li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
		<li>1 shot espresso, cooled or drip coffee</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
		<li>1-2 tablespoons plant milk soy, oat, or other</li>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol> 
		<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with nonstick spray.</li>
		<li>In a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the softened vegan butter, brown sugar, espresso powder and vanilla together until creamy. Now add the molasses and beat in until smooth. Scrape the sides as needed with a spatula.</li>
		<li>	Add the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix until combined. Place about a cup of granulated sugar in a bowl (this is optional, for rolling).</li>
		<li>	Scoop out about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough, roll into a ball, then roll each ball in the sugar until completely coated (or not, rolling in sugar is optional).</li>
		<li>	Place on the prepared baking sheets, and bake for 11-12 minutes, until they begin to crack on top. They will look very soft, but they firm up a lot as they cool. If you over bake, they will be crispy.</li>
		<li>	Let cool on the pans for 5-10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.</li>
		<li>	Make the espresso glaze: Whisk the glaze ingredients together until smooth and creamy. If it's too runny, add additional powdered sugar to thicken. If too thick, add a bit of milk.</li>
		<li>Drizzle glaze onto the cookies and let set for 10-20 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
